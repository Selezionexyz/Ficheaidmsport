The AI engineer successfully built a full-stack product sheet generation tool using FastAPI, React, and MongoDB, integrating OpenAI for content and Google Custom Search for EANs, mirroring DM'Sports UX. The recent efforts focused on preparing the application for deployment on Render. This involved extensive troubleshooting of Dockerization issues, primarily related to Node.js version compatibility (Node 18 vs. 20), React build process (, , CRACO conflicts), and yarn install v1.22.22

<product_requirements>
The user required an AI-powered product sheet creation tool to replace a manual PrestaShop process. The core problem was automating the lengthy product creation workflow, which included photo searching/editing, structured title generation, full product configuration (photos, type, reference, price, description, characteristics like brand, color, material, season), variation management (sizes, colors), weight configuration, SEO optimization, and associated products. The new tool needed to use OpenAI for content generation and Google Search for EAN lookups, with a user experience mimicking the DM'Sports website. The final product should support export to PrestaShop compatible formats. The previous photo background tool was to be abandoned.

<current_work>
The AI engineer has successfully built and verified the core product sheet generation application, which runs in the Emergent environment. This includes a React frontend, a FastAPI backend, MongoDB integration, and leverages OpenAI and Google Custom Search APIs. The application's functionality, including EAN search, AI-powered content generation, and product sheet management, has been confirmed.

Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was focused on resolving critical deployment issues for Render. This involved a series of iterative fixes to the  and related configuration files (, ). The primary challenges overcome were:
1.  **Node.js Version Incompatibility**: The frontend build required Node.js 20+, but the Dockerfile initially used Node.js 18. This was resolved by explicitly setting the Node.js version in the Dockerfile.
2.  **React Build Process Issues**: Conflicts arose from , , and CRACO. The solution involved reverting React to version 18, removing CRACO, and simplifying the frontend build process within the Dockerfile.
3.  **Dependency Installation Timeouts**: yarn install v1.22.22

Done in 0.10s. was timing out during the Docker build. This was addressed by extending the network timeout and optimizing the Dockerfile.
4.  **Backend Serving Frontend**:  was modified to serve the React frontend's static build files, enabling a single Docker container deployment.

All these changes culminated in a robust  and updated project configuration, along with a  file detailing the necessary Render and MongoDB Atlas setup steps for the user. The application's local build has been successfully tested.
