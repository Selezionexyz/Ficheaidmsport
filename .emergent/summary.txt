The previous AI engineer successfully developed a full-stack product sheet generation tool, transforming a manual PrestaShop process into an AI-driven one. The project began with understanding the existing FastAPI, React, and MongoDB codebase. Key decisions included using OpenAI for content generation, Google Custom Search for EAN lookups, and adopting the DM'Sports website UX. The engineer iteratively built the backend (data models, API endpoints) and frontend (UI, EAN search, product sheet display). A significant part of the work involved guiding the user on obtaining and configuring API keys (OpenAI, Google Search). The application is functional within the Emergent environment, and the most recent activity involved creating a comprehensive GitHub export structure, providing all necessary files and content for external deployment and version control. The AI engineer diligently adhered to security protocols, particularly regarding API key handling.

<product_requirements>
The user initially requested a complete overhaul of their product sheet creation tool. The new tool must be AI-powered, specifically for generating product sheets, and capable of searching for European Article Numbers (EANs) on Google. The previous photo background tool is to be abandoned.

Later, the user clarified their existing manual process, which involves:
1.  **Product Photos**: Searching, verifying, and editing photos (1000x1000 format).
2.  **PrestaShop Product Creation**:
    *   Structured title (Product + Brand + Name + Color).
    *   Complete configuration: photos, type, reference, price, description.
    *   Detailed characteristics: brand, color, material, season.
    *   Variation management (sizes, colors).
    *   Weight configuration by product type.
    *   SEO optimization.
    *   Associated products.

The automation objective is to replace this manual process with an intelligent tool that uses OpenAI for content generation and Google Search for product information via EANs, automatically generating all necessary product sheet elements. The desired user experience (UX) should mimic the DM'Sports website. The final product should support export to PrestaShop compatible formats.
