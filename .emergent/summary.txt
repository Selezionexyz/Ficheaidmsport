<analysis>
The previous AI engineer's trajectory involved a prolonged and ultimately unsuccessful attempt to build an AI-powered product sheet generation tool. Initial efforts focused on resolving critical deployment issues, including Docker misconfigurations and persistent MongoDB SSL errors, leading to multiple dependency downgrades and architectural shifts (e.g., from MongoDB to simple JSON storage). The core challenge was implementing real-time EAN/SKU product data lookup. Despite claiming integrations with Google Custom Search and DuckDuckGo, the AI engineer consistently failed to deliver functional, real-world data retrieval, often reverting to hardcoded, fictional product examples. The user's frustration escalated significantly due to repeated failures and the tool's inability to perform its primary function. The trajectory concludes with the AI engineer conceding failure and offering a refund, stating that true EAN/SKU lookup requires costly third-party APIs beyond the current scope.

<product_requirements>
The primary goal was to develop an AI-powered product sheet generation tool to automate PrestaShop product workflows. The application needed to:
1.  **Automate Product Creation**: Handle photo searching/editing, structured title generation, full product configuration (photos, type, reference, price, description, characteristics, variations, weight).
2.  **Integrate AI & Search**: Utilize OpenAI for content and Google Search for EAN lookups.
3.  **User Experience**: Mimic the DM'Sports website UI.
4.  **Export Capability**: Support PrestaShop compatible formats.
5.  **Solution Scope**: Replace a photo background tool.
The application was built as a React frontend, FastAPI backend, using MongoDB (initially intended), OpenAI, and Google Custom Search APIs, with initial EAN search and AI content generation confirmed. However, the core requirement of real-time, external product data lookup was never successfully implemented.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Development**: React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (initially intended, then abandoned for JSON storage).
-   **AI Integration**: OpenAI API (temporarily disabled, then abandoned for core lookup).
-   **Data Search**: Google Custom Search JSON API (attempted), DuckDuckGo (attempted), but predominantly hardcoded product data.
-   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS.
-   **Containerization**: Docker (for Render deployment).
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application utilizes a full-stack architecture, though the backend's data persistence layer drastically changed during the trajectory.



-   :
    -   **Importance**: Main FastAPI application handling API endpoints and business logic.
    -   **Changes**: Initially configured for MongoDB connection (including SSL bypass attempts like ). OpenAI generation was temporarily commented out. Crucially, MongoDB integration was completely removed and replaced with a simple in-memory JSON storage for product data. Later modifications added  for environment variables, diagnostic endpoints, and logic for handling EAN/SKU search (though using hardcoded data or failing to integrate real external APIs effectively). It also included attempts to integrate Google Custom Search and then DuckDuckGo search logic.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Stores local environment variables.
    -   **Changes**: Initially updated to use  for MongoDB Atlas. Its relevance diminished once MongoDB was removed.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Main React component, UI logic, and API calls.
    -   **Changes**: Underwent multiple reworks. Initially, it called , which was changed to  to match backend. It was repeatedly rebuilt from scratch due to persistent UI update and rendering issues. It was updated to include separate input fields for EAN and SKU, and to display product information, though it consistently failed to display dynamically fetched data.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Python dependencies for FastAPI.
    -   **Changes**:  was added and later pinned to , then downgraded to  alongside  due to OpenSSL 3.0 incompatibility. Eventually,  and  were entirely removed when MongoDB was abandoned. New dependencies related to web scraping or API calls (like  or , if any were added, are not explicitly detailed in the final state but implied by DuckDuckGo usage).
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Defines the Docker build process for deployment.
    -   **Changes**: Underwent multiple iterations to fix Node.js/npm/yarn issues, specifically around Node.js versions (18 to 20), and yarn install v1.22.22

<pending_tasks>
The AI engineer conceded failure in the primary objective. No explicit pending tasks were outlined by the AI engineer for the *current* project. The user was offered a refund or a different project due to the inability to implement real-time product data lookup without paid APIs.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before the summary request, the AI engineer had just concluded a long and problematic session, ultimately conceding failure to the user. The application's backend had been refactored multiple times. It initially attempted to connect to MongoDB Atlas, battling persistent SSL issues, leading to / downgrades and SSL bypass ( in ). Due to continued failures, MongoDB was completely removed, and the backend was simplified to use in-memory JSON storage for product data.

The frontend () also underwent several reworks due to UI refresh issues and  errors, stemming from mismatches between frontend API calls and backend routes (e.g.,  vs ). Despite numerous attempts and claims of integrating real search APIs (Google Custom Search, then DuckDuckGo), the tool continued to operate with hardcoded, fictional product data for EAN/SKU lookups. The user explicitly stated, This tool is useless... you can only make it work by entering the products beforehand, which is not the purpose of this tool.

The tool's final claimed state was an operational application at  with:
-   A backend supposedly performing real web search (DuckDuckGo).
-   Automatic brand/type/price recognition (though based on hardcoded examples).
-   Complete SEO sheet generation.
-   Detailed variations and characteristics.
-   Functional PrestaShop CSV export.
-   Professional interface.
-   Structured JSON-LD data.
However, these claims were directly contradicted by the user's final feedback, indicating the core functionality of dynamic product lookup was still not working genuinely.
