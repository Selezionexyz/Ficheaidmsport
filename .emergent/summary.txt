Subsequent issues shifted to persistent MongoDB connection problems, including  version compatibility, incorrect  configuration on Render, and finally, SSL certificate validation. Concurrently, an OpenAI quota error emerged, indicating core application functionality was reachable. The AI repeatedly guided the user on manual steps for Render environment variables and MongoDB Atlas setup, while iteratively fixing code issues. User frustration escalated significantly due to repeated failures. The last attempted fix involved bypassing MongoDB SSL validation in .

<product_requirements>
The primary goal was to create an AI-powered product sheet generation tool to automate a manual PrestaShop workflow. The tool needed to:
1.  **Automate Product Creation**: Streamline photo searching/editing, structured title generation, full product configuration (photos, type, reference, price, description, characteristics like brand, color, material, season), variation management (sizes, colors), and weight configuration.
2.  **Integrate AI & Search**: Utilize OpenAI for content generation and Google Search for EAN lookups.
3.  **User Experience**: Mimic the DM'Sports website's user interface.
4.  **Export Capability**: Support export to PrestaShop compatible formats.
5.  **Solution Scope**: Replace a previous photo background tool.
The application has been built and confirmed to run in the Emergent environment, comprising a React frontend, FastAPI backend, MongoDB, OpenAI, and Google Custom Search APIs, with core EAN search and AI-powered content generation confirmed.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture:

-   :
    -   **Importance**: Main FastAPI application handling API endpoints, business logic. It was modified to serve React frontend static files.
    -   **Changes**: Initially configured to serve React frontend. The AI generation logic (calling ) was temporarily commented out to disable OpenAI. A  parameter was added to the MongoDB connection string to address SSL errors.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Stores local environment variables.
    -   **Changes**: Modified from  to use the environment variable  which should point to MongoDB Atlas.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Main React component, UI logic, and API calls.
    -   **Changes**: No direct code changes were made in this trajectory, but its successful local build was a key diagnostic point.
-    & :
    -   **Importance**: Store frontend environment variables like .
    -   **Changes**: No direct modifications were made in this trajectory.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Python dependencies for FastAPI.
    -   **Changes**:  dependency was added, initially as , then pinned to  to resolve compatibility issues with .
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Node.js dependencies and scripts for React.
    -   **Changes**: No direct code changes were made; the file was inspected to understand build commands and dependencies.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Defines the Docker build process for deployment.
    -   **Changes**: Underwent multiple significant iterations:
        1.  Initial attempt with Node.js 18.
        2.  Updated to Node.js 20, simplified build steps, and attempted to use yarn install v1.22.22

<pending_tasks>
-   User needs to add billing/credits to their OpenAI account or generate and configure a new OpenAI API key in Render.
-   User needs to ensure the full, correct MongoDB Atlas connection string (MONGO_URL) is present in Render's environment variables without truncation.
-   User needs to commit the latest code changes (OpenAI disablement,  pin, SSL bypass) to their GitHub repository and trigger a new deployment on Render.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was deep in resolving persistent MongoDB connection issues on Render, which manifested as an SSL error. This followed previous fixes for Docker build problems (Node.js/npm/yarn conflicts) and an OpenAI quota error.

The specific actions taken in this final phase were:
1.  **Diagnosis of MongoDB SSL error**: The  identified that the  file locally was still pointing to  instead of the MongoDB Atlas URL.
2.  **Fixing **: The AI engineer modified  to use the correct  environment variable, ensuring the backend attempts to connect to MongoDB Atlas.
3.  **Bypassing SSL**: To address the persistent SSL handshake errors with MongoDB Atlas on Render, the AI engineer added  to the MongoDB connection string within . This change forces the client to bypass SSL certificate validation.

The OpenAI generation functionality was previously temporarily disabled in  to allow testing of core application deployment without hitting quota limits, so the current state is that the app should connect to MongoDB Atlas (with SSL bypass) and provide test data rather than AI-generated content.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Await the user's test result after the last MongoDB SSL fix. If the application still fails to function, call  for a radical solution as promised.
